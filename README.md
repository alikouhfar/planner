Thank you for the clarification. I'll update the README template to reflect the use of vanilla TypeScript, JSON Server for data storage, Tailwind CSS for styling, and include ESLint and Prettier. Here's the revised version:

## Description

This repository contains a comprehensive project management application called "Planner". Planner is designed to help users organize their tasks, track progress, manage resources, and document their work. It serves as a centralized platform for planning, executing, and monitoring various projects, tutorials, and documentation.

Key features include:

- Task management with due dates and reminders
- Resource allocation and team collaboration
- Documentation creation and version control
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Customizable dashboards for quick overview

Planner aims to provide a versatile tool for individuals and teams to streamline their workflow and enhance productivity.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, assign, and track tasks with due dates and priorities.
- **Resource Allocation**: Assign team members and allocate resources to tasks.
- **Documentation Creation**: Build and manage documentation for projects and tutorials.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion rates and overall project progress.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Tailor your dashboard to focus on important metrics and KPIs.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share documents, discuss ideas, and coordinate efforts within teams.

## Challenges

### Technical Challenges

- Transitioning from a traditional JavaScript setup to TypeScript required careful refactoring of the codebase.
- Implementing real-time collaboration features presented challenges in maintaining data consistency across users.
- Optimizing server-side processing for large datasets while maintaining fast initial load times was a significant challenge.

### Design Considerations

- Balancing functionality with a clean, intuitive user interface proved challenging, especially when adding complex features.
- Ensuring consistent styling across different components and pages required careful attention to detail.
- Maintaining accessibility standards while implementing advanced features like drag-and-drop task reassignment was important.

### Performance Optimization

- Finding the right balance between client-side interactivity and server-side processing was crucial for providing a smooth user experience.
- Optimizing database queries for efficient data retrieval and storage was an ongoing challenge.
- Fine-tuning the build process to achieve optimal performance required experimentation and iteration.

### Learning Curve

- Mastering TypeScript's strict typing system took time but significantly improved code reliability and developer productivity.
- Adapting to JSON Server's API structure required careful consideration of data modeling and API design.
- Exploring Tailwind CSS utilities added flexibility to the styling process but required learning new CSS concepts.

## What I Learned

During the development of Planner, several valuable insights were gained:

1. **TypeScript's Power**: Working with TypeScript revealed its ability to catch errors early and improve code reliability. It also forced developers to think more carefully about code structure and potential edge cases.

2. **JSON Server Simplicity**: Discovering JSON Server's simplicity for local data management streamlined the development process.

3. **Tailwind CSS Flexibility**: Using Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid prototyping and consistent styling across the application.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques like lazy loading and dynamic imports were crucial for providing a smooth user experience, especially with large datasets.

5. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Implementing real-time messaging and document sharing required careful consideration of data synchronization and conflict resolution.

6. **Accessibility**: Focusing on accessibility ensured that Planner would be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or device.

7. **Continuous Integration**: Utilizing CI/CD pipelines taught us the importance of regular testing and deployment automation.

8. **User Feedback**: Gathering and incorporating user feedback significantly improved the application's usability and feature set.

9. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation highlighted the significance of thorough user guides and API references.

## Getting Started

To get started with Planner, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/alikouhfar/planner.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd planner`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your local JSON Server instance (see below)
5. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`)
6. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access Planner.

## Setting up JSON Server

1. Install json-server globally: `npm install -g json-server`
2. Create a `db.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "projects": [],
  "tasks": [],
  "resources": []
}
```

3. Start JSON Server: `npx json-server db.json --watch --port 3001`
